## Abstract (SGIM National Meeting. Orlando, FL 04/2022)

**Background:** Recent studies in healthcare delivery add to the importance of measuring wellbeing of the healthcare workforce due to finding an association between quality of care and workforce wellbeing.  It has been speculated that high rates of burnout may be due to oversensitivity to the construct, but no consensus has been reached. 

**Objective:** We examined the association of staff response rates and reported rates of work stress and engagement. 

**Methods:**  Panel study. We included 133 English acute and combined Trusts participating in the National Health Service (NHS) Staff Surveys for the year 2019. We measured response rates, workforce engagement, and work stress using the NHS Staff Survey. Regression analysis was performed of response rates for predicting rates of work stress and engagement.  

**Results:** The overall response rate was 46% (range: 27% to 76%). In univariable regression, increased response rate correlated with lower rates of work stress. On the contrary, increased response rate positively correlated with rates of engagement. Both associations were statistically significant with p-values of 0.001 and 0.002, respectively. The contribution of the response rate to variance as measured by R2 was 6.9% and 6.3%, respectively. Across the range of response rates, predicted rates of engagement ranged from 73% to 77% while predicted rates of stress ranged from 42% to 37% 

**Conclusions:** Higher response rates correlated with lower reports of work stress and higher reports of engagement. Surveyors should consider response rates when interpreting rates of well-being as reported across sites or over time in their organizations.
